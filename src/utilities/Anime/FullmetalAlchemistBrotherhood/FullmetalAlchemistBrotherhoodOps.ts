    "We live for each other, can you hear me starting to scream? \n Because we can't play it safe or sound anymore, and we don't have a place to go home to. \n You're always thanking me for being kind. That's why I want to get stronger. \n Just like old times. This is the kind of pain I love.",
    "What, you don't got enough life left to wipe these feelings out? \n To try to make right the things you left undone. \n Let's go one more time. \n We try chasing down ways to further our dream, \n But then we trip over people on the narrow path that winds.",
    "It's nothing like wanting to go back to those days. \n I'm searching for a sky that doesn't exist anymore. \n Don't give me that sad face like I've become the victim, \n Like you understand.",
    "Tears aren't the end of sin. You carry it heavy on your back forever. \n Who is it you're waiting for in this maze of emotion you can't find your way out of? \n I want to let it all spill already like I was writing in a blank notebook. \n What're you're trying to get away from, this thing we call reality?",

    "The direct light intersects itself \n And without even announcing my destination, I break through to everywhere \n The faint afterimage is burnt into my eyes \n With a black-and-white sticker that we put on unwittingly \n We hid the important things",
    "Lured by a pure white scenery now \n I'll go to a world that I still haven't seen \n",
    "Someday, even with my strides as I am tiny \n Many dreams stained through the map that changes daily \n Someday, even with my strides as I am tiny \n I wonder if I can get to the other side of those clouds",
    "I pretended to be strong and got hurt \n as if they looked through my heart \n The raindrops that started to fall repeatedly ricochet everywhere"

    "The perfect 'golden time'- I'll seize it with these hands; \n finish this by battling with a poker face that takes everything I've got \n Dragged away to an illusory world",
    "I can't concentrate; my body is still hesitant \n It was trembling, but the blurry thought comes- 'I controlled it' \n Nothing is facing my way- not the sun, nor the luck dictating 'victory' or 'defeat', but \n I muttered 'I've got to go for it' to persuade myself",
    "The situation looks grim, but it's gutless to just run away \n I can't see how things will end, but all I can do is courageously advance, \n hold my instincts in check, and search the target for an opening \n The only thing you need is 'pride in victory'- \n whether we taste the high-grade sake of 'triumph' or the bitterness of 'defeat',\n they're just two parts of the same thing: the thread of fate I wish to manipulate.",
    "Escaping from this endless pressure game \n so I can clear the borderline of glory \n How many? How many reparations must be made? \n What do you wish to avoid losing hold of?"
