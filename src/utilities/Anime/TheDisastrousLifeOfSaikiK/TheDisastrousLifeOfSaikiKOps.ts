    "I don't want to get hurt, but I want to know more about you \n The truth is always deep inside your eyes \n I don't want to hurt you, but I want you to know me \n Youth isn't cruel so let's look at each other in the eyes",
    "The color surrounding you was different from that of other people \n You smiled vaguely and I softly averted my eyes",
    "I decided it's okay to tell lies as long as they are kind \n And you caught on to that \n Thereafter I too realized the fact that you found out",
